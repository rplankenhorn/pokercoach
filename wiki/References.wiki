If you hold 87s, then you may flop 9-10-j , 6-9-10, 5-6-9, 4-5-6 with each occurring with probability (4^3 - 1)/50C3. The probability you flop a straight is therefore, (4^4-4)/50C3 ~ 1.2857% . This excludes the possibility that you flop a straight flush (4 of them) which needs to be subtracted from the overal total.Â
